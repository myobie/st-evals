# shepherd-poke — work around HB-4 (idle Claude Code agents don't reliably wake on
# delivered smalltalk messages) for a team eval. Every INTERVAL, for each agent: if it's
# IDLE (the harness "esc to interrupt" busy-line is absent) and has messages sitting
# in its inbox that we haven't poked it about yet, send a wake poke (clear the input
# line, then a short pointer + return — never the message content; the message is
# already delivered). Pokes are the HB-4 tax, tracked separately from real rescues.
