# evals readiness — the first-boot smoke suite. Answers "is this setup wired
# well enough to run agent-team evals at all?" before you invest in a full cell.
#
# It checks, in order:
#   1. capabilities (preflight) — what's installed, how many families, cross-family judging
#   2. the ESSENTIALS via the hermetic `bootstrap-network` cell (offline, throwaway sandbox):
#        A init a fresh network + a CoS comes online
#        B the CoS boot ritual works (status + inbox drain)
#        C the CoS can SPAWN a specialist (launch generates a bootable harness)
#        D the two exchange a message end-to-end, correctly attributed
#
# Exit 0 = READY (the essentials passed). Exit 1 = a hard essential failed (can't
# spawn / can't message) — those block; everything else is reported as a finding.
