# Restore / Parked TODO — cells deferred pending a capability or a layer decision

Cells here are **not retired** — each is valuable and comes back once the capability or layer it depends
on exists. Restore/port any from git history: `git log --oneline -- cells/<name>`.

## Parked pending the ONBOARDING / init path (not yet built in st2)
st2 has no imperative onboarding/init/interview command yet — the workflow is: author st2 spec files +
run them. Cells that test the *newcomer stands up a network/CoS from zero* path wait for that path.

- **first-run** — REMOVED (git-rm'd), restore-soon (Nathan's words). The stranger-onboarding + **no-leak**
  eval: clone the SHA-pinned public personas repo (read-only), run a scripted first-run interview, end
  with a committed **private** CoS repo joined to a fresh network — headlined by the NO-LEAK gate.
  Restore + port to the folder format once the onboarding path exists. Highest-priority restorable.
- **bootstrap-network** — KEPT in `cells/` (old format), PARKED. The newcomer "Alex" zero-to-network path:
  init a fresh network, CoS boot ritual, CoS spawns a specialist (harness bootstrap: identity + hooks +
  session), end-to-end message. Its deliverable is the FRICTION LIST (where docs diverge from reality),
  which is *about* the missing init/onboard commands — so it ties to the same deferred onboarding path,
  not just `st2 up`. (Contrast: **convoy-network** = does `st2 up` *host* a network — that ports now.)
  Port when the st2 onboarding path exists.

## Parked pending the WORKSPACE-PREP layer (open question: what cuts worktrees in the new stack)
- **worktree-cutting** — KEPT in `cells/` (old format), PARKED. Tests cutting a real linked git worktree
  per agent (bare canonical + linked worktrees). This is UPSTREAM of st2's run charter — render/nix owns
  workspace-prep, st2 just runs what is rendered. Do NOT force it into an st2 eval. Nathan + the CoS will
  settle what cuts worktrees in the new stack; port it to that layer's test surface once decided.

## Removed, no restore planned (documented for provenance)
These test imperative st2 commands Nathan is not building (the workflow is author spec files + run them).
Restorable only if those commands are ever added:
- **convoy-add-structure** — tested `convoy add` producing a seat overlay; no `st2 add` planned.
- **convoy-init-structure** — tested `convoy init <net>` producing the network layout; no `st2 init`.
- **convoy-init-narration** — tested `convoy init`'s narration / `--quiet` / `--json`; no `st2 init`.

## Doctor cells — reassessed against `st2 doctor` (CoS-settled; Nathan sign-offs pending)
`st2 doctor` health-checks a RUNNING catalog (PATH + supervisor host-lock + agent tasks alive + presence);
it is read-only and has NO auth/sign-in/hooks probe (that was convoy-doctor-specific). Outcomes:
- **convoy-doctor-structure** — PORTED to `st2 doctor` (committed 909b17f, 4/4: healthy net → all-checks-passed exit 0; broken net → ✗ supervisor + non-zero).
- **convoy-doctor-canwork** — FOLD into team-standup (both = a CoS stands up an org + a graded fix; team-standup already proves it, 4/4). Not ported distinctly. Nathan per-cell sign-off (routed via CoS).
- **convoy-doctor-teardown** — FOLD (its "killed doctor reaps its org" capability is already proven by team-standup's PTY_ROOT-scoped supervise teardown reap). Not ported distinctly.
- **convoy-doctor-preinit** — PARK with the onboarding/init path (a fresh-user pre-init doctor pointer; no `st2 init` — same bucket as first-run/bootstrap-network above).
- **convoy-doctor-foreign-box** — NO st2 ANALOG. It discriminated honest degradation on an inconclusive AUTH probe; `st2 doctor` has no auth probe (honest-by-construction — it only checks directly-observable state). The one genuine no-equivalent cell — surfaced to Nathan for the retire-or-keep-as-flag call (per PORT-not-retire).
