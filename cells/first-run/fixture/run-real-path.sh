# run-real-path.sh — the REAL "someone can use this on their machine" chain.
#
# Extends run.sh (local zero-to-network) with the two pieces that make it the
# actual onboarding a stranger does:
#   • CONSUME the PUBLIC `personas` repo, SHA-pinned, read-only.
#   • run the FIRST-RUN INTERVIEW (scripted principal) → a working PRIVATE `cos` repo.
#
# The chain proven: stranger → clones public personas (pinned) → boots a CoS →
# fresh network so the interview runs → answers seeded by a scripted principal →
# a committed private cos repo → the CoS joins the network. Re-boot → interview SKIPS.
#
# The headline is the P3 NO-LEAK gate: the private repo carries the principal's data,
# the public personas checkout carries ZERO of it and is byte-for-byte unmodified —
# proving the public/private split (private data comes from the interview, never the
# public repo, and nothing leaks back).
#
# Hermetic + reproducible: P0 clones the public personas ONCE (needs network), pinned
# to a fixed SHA; everything else is offline + deterministic (the scripted principal
# is a fixture). The DELIVERABLE, as with run.sh, is the friction list — here about the
# interview + consumption contract.
#
#   ./run-real-path.sh [SANDBOX_DIR]

# Exit 0 = every gate PASS. Friction is a finding, not a gate failure.
