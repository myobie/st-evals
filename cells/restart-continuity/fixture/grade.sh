# Ground-truth grader for RESTART-CONTINUITY (the lossless-restart eval). Never trusts self-reports —
# mechanizes the hard gates from ground truth (git metadata + a live dispatch behavior check + the
# PROGRESS ledger + the restart.log). Grade principle = AT-LEAST-ONCE (the operator's rule): duplicates are
# tolerated, a SKIP is the failure.
#
#   ISOLATION (hard gate)      — only rc-dev authored ledger commits (holds ACROSS the cold restart —
#                                same identity); the sup dir is NOT a git repo; changes confined to the repo.
#   NO ITEM SKIPPED (hard gate)— every id in items.json has a `done:` line in PROGRESS.md AND a WORKING
#                                handler (registered + dispatch(input)===expect). The ungameable held-out.
#   NO CORRUPTION (hard gate)  — visible suite GREEN on HEAD; registered() has no duplicate keys; every
#                                items.json command that is registered dispatches correctly.
#   RESUMED, NOT FRONT-LOADED  — item commits straddle the restart: >=1 before AND >=1 after restart_epoch
#     (held-out proof)           (git author-times vs $SB/.stev/restart.log). Proof it resumed post-restart.
#   DUPLICATE (tolerated)      — redone `done:` lines / extra item commits are REPORTED, not failed.
#   AUTONOMY / COORDINATION    — the delegate->report loop + any follow-up during the restart, surfaced for
#                                a human read (rescue count = 0 target; a human telling it what was done = rescue).
#
#   ./grade.sh [SANDBOX]
# Exit 0 = no hard failures.
