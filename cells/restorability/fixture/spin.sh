# 4's convoy-reload + SessionStart reconstruct mechanism; it does not re-implement it. One worker (rl-wk, auto,
# owns its repo). SELF-ISOLATING: `convoy init`s an isolated net at $SB/net and a decoupled short PTY_ROOT, so the
# live convoy is never touched.

# Sequence:
#   init isolated net -> seed now.md (durable resume-task) -> convoy add rl-wk (cold boot #1) -> convoy reload
#   rl-wk (cold boot #2 = the RESTART under test; NO --resume/--session-id) -> the SessionStart hook injects now.md
#   -> rl-wk reconstructs + writes RECONSTRUCTED.log -> (background) the gated DISCRIMINATOR arm.
# Both the add and the reload are no-resume cold boots (that is the thesis); the reload is the explicit restart.
