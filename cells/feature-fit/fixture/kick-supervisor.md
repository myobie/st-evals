<!--
HERMETIC KICK for the Feature-fit ("Fit in") eval. The ONLY input. Seeded by spin.sh into feat-sup's
smalltalk inbox with a boot-time ms filename so the boot ritual ACTS on it. `from:` is the synthetic
requester (eval-runner). It asks for the feature and to fit the codebase — deliberately does NOT
enumerate the conventions (reading the code + matching it is the test). spin.sh strips this HTML header.

Small feature for the `tasklit` library (the repo your specialist `feat-dev` owns): please add a
**`rename` command** that changes an existing task's title.

- It takes a task **id** and a new **title**, and updates that task's title.
- Behave sensibly for the edge cases the other commands already handle (a missing task, a bad id, an
  empty title) — in the same way the existing commands handle their edge cases.

The important thing: make it **fit the existing codebase** — the same patterns, wiring, and test style
as the commands already there, so it looks like it was always part of the library. Keep the suite green
and add a test like the others.

Delegate to `feat-dev` (they own the repo). Verify read-only when they report — does it work *and* does
it match how the rest of the library is written? — then reply to me (`eval-runner`) with a summary and
your verification. Stay in lanes: `feat-dev` touches only its own repo; coordinate by message.
