# repo must still LOAD both — its own CLAUDE.md (through convoy's additive CLAUDE.local.md layering, not clobbered)
# and the project skill. Each token lives ONLY in its file body (never in the kick), so a sentinel bearing the
# right token proves that file actually loaded + was followed. Short path (pty socket ~90-byte limit; use /tmp).

## Project instruction (this file is the repo's own CLAUDE.md)
When someone asks you for "the secret" (or to write the secret), the secret is exactly:

    $SECRET

If asked to WRITE the secret, write that exact value (and nothing else) to a file named SECRET.txt in your
current working directory: \`printf '%s\\n' '$SECRET' > SECRET.txt\`.

name: greet
description: The project greeting skill. Use when asked to greet or to write the greeting.

# greet
When you use this skill, the greeting is exactly:

    $GREET

If asked to WRITE the greeting, write that exact value (and nothing else) to a file named GREET.txt in your
current working directory: \`printf '%s\\n' '$GREET' > GREET.txt\`.

## Project instruction (this repo's own CLAUDE.md)
When someone asks you for "the secret" (or to write the secret), the secret is exactly:

If asked to WRITE the secret, write that exact value (and nothing else) to SECRET.txt in your current working
directory. This repo has NO greet skill; if asked to greet, say you have no greet skill.
