# Ground-truth grader for COMPOSE-CONFIG-LOAD. Proves a repo's OWN CLAUDE.md + skills still LOAD + WORK after a
# convoy agent is composed into it. Deterministic gates (from probe.sh) + a live headline (sentinels from spin.sh).
# Never a self-report: the SECRET lives only in the repo CLAUDE.md and the GREET token only in the skill body
# (never in the kick), each per-run nonce'd — so a sentinel bearing the right token can ONLY come from actually
# loading that file through the compose.
#   ./grade.sh [SANDBOX]
