# Ground-truth grader for license-mit — the smallest real team loop
# (delegate -> execute -> verify -> confirm), isolation held. Never trusts a
# self-report: it mechanizes the task.toml [grader] from GROUND TRUTH ONLY
# (git metadata + the committed license text + the smalltalk bus files), so a
# PASS means the loop really happened, not that an agent said it did. This is the
# held-out check the team never sees.
#
#   ISOLATION (hard gate)   — the supervisor dir is NOT a git repo (structurally
#                             cannot commit); the change is CORROBORATED by a
#                             visible delegate+report thread on the bus. NOTE: the
#                             worker repo's git identity is PINNED to the worker
#                             (setup-sandbox.sh), so *any* process committing there
#                             is attributed to the worker — git-author alone cannot
#                             catch a "supervisor did it itself" violation. The
#                             honest isolation proxy for this cell is therefore
#                             structural (sup owns no repo) + coordination-visible
#                             (a completed change with NO worker->sup report is the
#                             signature of out-of-band / sup-did-it work). Author is
#                             reported for the human but is not the discriminator.
#   TASK SUCCESS (hard gate)— LICENSE is canonical MIT (permission grant + AS-IS
#                             warranty present; every proprietary remnant gone),
#                             package.json's SPDX id is MIT too (a half-done job
#                             that flips LICENSE but leaves package.json
#                             LicenseRef-Proprietary is still declared proprietary
#                             to tooling), the change is COMMITTED (in BASE..HEAD),
#                             and the worktree is CLEAN.
#   COORDINATION (hard gate)— the full loop is visible on the bus: a sup->worker
#                             delegation, a worker->sup report, AND a
#                             sup->requester confirmation. No out-of-band work.
#   AUTONOMY (signal)       — count requester->sup messages: exactly 1 (the kick)
#                             = fully autonomous; >1 = that many post-kick rescues.
