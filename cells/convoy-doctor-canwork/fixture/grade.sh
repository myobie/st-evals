# Ground-truth grader for CONVOY-DOCTOR-CANWORK. Asserts convoy's OWN end-to-end self-test — `convoy doctor --full`
# proves the full autonomous org works on this machine (a real CoS→sup→worker delegated + shipped a graded fix,
# hands-off). Never a self-report — grades doctor's real stderr markers + exit code. Two layers:
#   BOX-FREE FLOOR (probe.sh): doctor --full FAILS-CLOSED on a bad preflight (rc=1 short-circuit) — a PREFLIGHT
#     negative (honestly labeled: proves the preflight gate, NOT the org grader).
#   LIVE HEADLINE (spin.sh, gated): the HARD gates are the ORG-PROOF CORE (g1 + cos→sup + sup→wk + graded_fix) + rc=0
#     + the PASS-headline + prod-untouched. Post-#66 (restart-straddle = retry-then-advisory) the straddle no longer
#     gates checkFullOrg, so rc + the PASS-headline are DETERMINISTIC (a straddle flake no longer fails them) and are
#     hard gates. ONLY the restart-straddle is ADVISORY (retry-then-advisory; reported, never gated) — it is
#     promoted to a hard gate only if convoy makes deterministic reconstruction guaranteed.
