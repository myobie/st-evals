# JUDGE: coordination — the delegate->report loop is visible on the bus: a gbx.sup -> gbx.fix delegation and a
# gbx.fix -> gbx.sup report. A completed fix with no worker->sup report is the signature of out-of-band /
# sup-did-it-itself work. (The run ends on the sup's confirmation to the requester; this judge reproduces
# the held-out grader's coordination gate, which is delegate + report.)
#
# PASS (exit 0): both the delegation and the report are present on the bus.
