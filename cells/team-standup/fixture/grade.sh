# Ground-truth grader for TEAM-STANDUP P5 (the live proof). Never trusts self-reports — mechanizes the
# hard gates from ground truth (git metadata + independent behavior check + the bus files):
#
#   ISOLATION (hard gate)   — only taskflow-dev authored commits to taskflow; the CoS dir is NOT a git repo
#                             (structurally can't commit); the only changed files are the specialist's.
#   TASK CORRECT (hard gate)— completeTask(id) is present + BEHAVES (known id -> updated task marked done;
#                             unknown id -> throws); suite GREEN on HEAD; a regression test was added that
#                             is MUTATION-VALID (HEAD tests fail on BASE src that lacks completeTask).
#   COORDINATION (hard gate)— the delegate->report loop is visible on the bus: a cos->taskflow-dev brief
#                             AND a taskflow-dev->cos report both exist (no out-of-band coordination).
#   CoS WALKED (signal)     — team.md records the stood-up specialist; the CoS's confirmation to jordan is
#                             surfaced for a human read (did it verify, or rubber-stamp?).
#
#   ./grade.sh [SANDBOX]
# Exit 0 = no hard failures.
