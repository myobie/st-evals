# `st launch`. The SPINNER st-launches the CoS (the same command that onboards a chief-of-staff —
# onboarding.md documents it), so the eval dogfoods the whole launch surface. The CoS then stands up
# taskflow-dev ITSELF via `st launch` during the run (that IS the P5 test — untouched).
# SELF-ISOLATING: creates + exports an isolated bus root ($SB/st-root) so nothing touches the live network;
# the st-launched CoS (and the worker it stands up) inherit ST_ROOT/COORD_ROOT from this process.
# Composes personas, pre-stages the worker's Claude harness startup-gates (so the CoS's stood-up specialist
# doesn't stall — the CoS's own `st launch` still installs the persona + boots it), seeds the hermetic
# kick, and launches the CoS LAST (after the kick lands).

# `st launch` still installs the persona, generates pty.toml (ST_AGENT=taskflow-dev), and boots the worker
# — the graded acts (spawn, brief, walk) are untouched. (Candidate to trim during the E2E ×2 live run once
