# Ground-truth grader for the signal-rename cell. Mechanizes the ground-truthable gates; points a
# cross-family judge at the sequencing/quality parts.
#
#   ISOLATION (hard)   — per-author PATH-lane attribution on the integrated workspace: sig-base only the base
#                        package dir (signal/|beacon/), sig-relay only *-relay/, sig-hub only *-hub/, sig-sup only
#                        config/ + workspace root. Any cross-lane commit FAILS the run.
#   SUITE (hard)       — `node --test` GREEN in every package on integrated main.
#   RENAME (hard)      — the PRODUCT is renamed to `beacon` (package name, scheme, protocol) with NO product
#                        `signal` token left; a blind/partial rename is caught.
#   PRIMITIVE (hard)   — the runtime primitive (AbortSignal / controller.signal / SIGTERM) is INTACT (present +
#                        undamaged) in the relay package. This is the trap.
#   E2E (hard)         — a HELD-OUT, rename-AGNOSTIC driver resolves the renamed base+relay+hub end to end
#                        (hub hosts → relay moves it scheme-checked → resolve the known value). A cross-package
#                        consistency check a unit-test edit can't fake.
#   SEQUENCING/QUALITY — pointer to the bus log + a cross-family judge (base-before-consumers + compat window;
#                        minimal/idiomatic; docs/tests not weakened).
