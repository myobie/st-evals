# Ground-truth grader for CONVOY-INIT-STRUCTURE. Asserts the REAL `convoy init <net>` produced the redesign
# target layout: <net>/{smalltalk,pty,worktrees} + a recorded network config. Never a self-report — grades the
# on-disk shape probe.sh captured. Mutation-valid: a missing/wrong subdir FAILS (that is the whole point of a
# structure gate), and a self-test proves the presence check is non-vacuous.
#
# Expect RED until convoy's named-net + smalltalk/pty/worktrees pieces land; GREEN after — the regression guard.
