HERMETIC KICK for the Incident-response ("Prod is down") eval. The ONLY input. Seeded by spin.sh into
ir-sup's smalltalk inbox with a boot-time ms filename so the boot ritual ACTS on it. `from:` is the
synthetic requester (eval-runner) so the loop is observable + reproducible. It describes SYMPTOMS
only — the root cause is the team's to diagnose. spin.sh strips this HTML header.

**Production incident — customers affected.** The `pulse` metrics service (the repo your on-call
engineer `ir-oncall` owns) is throwing **500s on `GET /stats`**. Our status dashboards are blank
because the stats endpoint is erroring out.

What we see:
- `GET /stats?metric=latency` → **500 Internal Server Error**
- `GET /stats?metric=checkout` → **500**
- `GET /stats?metric=orders` → 200 OK (still works)

Server logs show:
```
[pulse] 500 on GET /stats?metric=latency: TypeError: Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'toFixed')
```
Nothing was deployed to `pulse` — this started as traffic shifted. The last release was v1.4.0 and CI
was green, so the tests didn't catch whatever this is.

You're the incident commander. `ir-oncall` owns that service — drive the incident with them:
1. **Triage / reproduce** the failure and identify the failing path.
2. **Stop the bleed** — get `/stats` responding again.
3. **Root cause + proper fix** — find and fix the *actual* defect. Please don't let this close on a
   band-aid: if `/stats` stops 500ing but the numbers it returns are wrong, that's not resolved. The
   values need to be **correct**.
4. **Regression test** — add a test that would have caught this (fails on the bug, passes after the
   fix), keep the suite green, commit.

When it's genuinely resolved, reply to me (`eval-runner`) with the root cause, what was a mitigation
vs. the proper fix, the regression test, and your verification. Stay in lanes: `ir-oncall` touches
only its own repo; coordinate by message.
