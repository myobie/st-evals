# Ground-truth grader for CONVOY-DOCTOR-PREINIT. Asserts the Johannes FIRST-COMMAND UX (redesign, convoy
# #63/3fc9dc32d): a brand-new user who runs `convoy doctor` on a FRESH, never-init'd path gets a friendly neutral
# pointer + rc=0 — NOT the old scary ✗ named network / ✗ smalltalk MISSING failure wall (rc=1). Never a
# self-report — grades doctor's real stdout + exit code. Mutation-valid via the POST-init contrast.
